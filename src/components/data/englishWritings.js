		"content": "What makes us happy? Seeing people doing the things which we like? Or knowing that someone is actually interested in our talks? Or maybe its their innocent way of answering our questions? Sounds immature right? So these are the things u think when you get connected to someone so deeply that even their absence for a second bothers you? It makes you feel alone? Does it make you feel that there is noone in this world except you and your lost soul? Why such small things about a person are so important to us? So this makes you happy or drown you in the sea of sorrow? I repeat, what makes you happy?",

		"content": "Life and death. What is this all about? They say you have got this life for a reason even when life teaches us that you are a life to someone. They say you should find your aim when the only goal you wanna achieve is he/she. They say you will have to pay in hell for your sins but who will tell them that life has already became hell the moment he/she walked out of the door. Is life all about this? Is this all about the magical path of life?Life is not about surviving because of others, its about surviving yourself for others. They say it's a lesson for us whereas it's the beginning of a new chapter for others. Even after having all those beautiful things in your life, is you soul still crying for help? So why should we live? We live because others want us to, and we want them to live along with us. We live because we have hope, and want to see what happens next. We live because there are people who love us, and people we love back. We live because we want to find out things, and learn, and become able to do things that we would like to do.Life is just like a metal which get rusted with time but tries everything for surviving itself. So life is just not about living and dying, it's way more than that. Walk through this magical path and find your answers.",

		"title": "Overthinking",
		"content": "Everyone had a different experience and i can't even think or understand how much that person has gone through. You can see and hear the things around you but you just can't accept it. It doesn't seem real, it feels as if someone is whispering in our ears and urging us to think of the worst way for that thing to happen. It's a strange feeling of being aware that you are still alive but nothing inside you is quite there. It's more like drowning yourself deeply inside the sea. This sea is nothing but your thoughts of analysing the things, thinking of the worst ways that could hurt you, thinking of the worst outcomes, thinking of the worst situation you could face and thinking of the worst things that could happen to you. But the important thing to understand, or for everyone else to understand is to, you are not the sea, your overthinking is. You can't control the sea, and when it gets too much yes you might get angry at yourself for not fighting harder, but in the moment you couldn’t. Sometimes just breathing takes everything you have, and that’s just the way it is. It’s okay. The sea is not your fault.  Overthinking isn't anyone's fault.",

		"content": "Stepped down with a light in my eyes Now i am lost in the dark night skies, Willing to become perfect one day I wish i could make everyone stay someday, Eyes are open and tears are rolling Don't come near, the pain will start doling, Seeing everything from the positive side The self sufficient quality was never satisfied, If silence is everything that helps us grow Why is life keeping me always below, One day someone will pull me above I will sit silently for the whisper of love.",

		"title": "Being an introvert",
		"content": "Today i will write about what my heart really feels instead of what i really want to make you all feel. Yes i am an introvert and i don't hate human beings, i am not anti social but ya maybe a little weird. I have my way of seeing things and approaching them. I am not shy, i can talk to 100 of people without even thinking twice. I don't lack confidence. I have a large ego - too large some would say. But trust me it takes a large amount of time and energy from me to have a conversation with someone so i will seriously end up getting exhausted if i have to talk to dozens of people in a day. I find it hard to approach people without a good reason. Another thing with friendships that it's sometimes hard, some of my friends are extroverts, with all caps. It makes me tired from time to time, to watch them go, to listen to them talk endlessly, having them ask me if I’m ok because I haven’t said a word in a while. I’m fine, I’m just… I’m fine with silence, and I’m fine with not doing anything. I hate fighting with people not only because fighting is never nice, but because that is the only thing that really just makes me cry, and it’s out of my control. I cry out of frustration more than anything else, and I never know what to say. Also, whenever someone tells me something that requires a big reaction, I always fail 100%. A person could be pouring out their soul to me, and I would just sit there with a blank expression, because I feel stupid displaying the amount of compassion, sorrow, happiness, love, disgust, whatever it is that I’m feeling at that moment. I am feeling all of those things, I just don’t know how to show it. We are raised believing that in order to be normal is to be sociable. Everything from eating to watching movies or reading a book has become a group activity. Even our school systems force introverts to be someone they are not. For as long as I can remember, I believed that there was something wrong with me. Growing up I was more on the quiet side. At this point in my life, I am comfortable with who I am. I sometimes hear that being an introvert is a cop-out, and I could change if I wanted to. I don’t want to change who I am.",

		"content": "Why are nights so peaceful? All your hard work or struggle you did suddenly vanishes out in the dark. Even in the crowd of thousands of people, my body becomes numb and starts losing my calm. Though i am afraid of looking at the sky, gazing the stars still gives me goosebumps. And these goosebumps are not because of the fear, it's because of the immense peace i feel inside me. Everything i have ever gone through suddenly starts running through my mind and that mature person inside me starts thinking like a child. The blood flow starts increasing and loud noises around me starts murmuring. In that very moment i start losing myself and i close my eyes and loudly but steadily the voice inside me dies. Starting my day again with the bright light, it all ends up with my so called peaceful night.",

		"title": "Choosing the path",
		"content": "In the middle of the night, with wide open eyes, wet with emotions and the constant fear of losing everything, I had became someone you will not want to love. I was sickly cold, thirsty for everything, but I was stuck in that moment so badly that the only thing that was working were my stupid emotions for everything. Where is the rope of hope, I cannot see it, can you? It felt like I was beneath a bright sunny sky but with less of its sunshine and the worst part was that I was still trying to find the dark spots in it. Sometimes it's not the life that takes you everywhere, it's you and your complexities that helps you choose your path. In that very moment do everything that could slide away the clouds of sorrow. You will find the beauty in those dark spots too.",
